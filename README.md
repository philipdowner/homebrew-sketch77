# Homebrew Cask for Sketch v77

Sketch v77 is the last version that I have a paid license for, and it suits my needs perfectly. This tap allows me to install that version directly, rather than the latest version.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install philipdowner/sketch77/<formula>`

Or `brew tap philipdowner/sketch77` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
